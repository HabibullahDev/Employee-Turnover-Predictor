## Employee Turnover Predictor

Welcome to the Employee Turnover Predictor project! Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict employee turnover in organizations. By analyzing various factors, we aim to provide insights and help companies identify employees who may be at risk of leaving.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the file HR_comma_sep.csv. It contains information about employees, including their satisfaction level, last evaluation score, average monthly hours, number of projects, and churn status.

Notebook
The notebook HR_Prediction_Tasks.ipynb contains the code and analysis for this project. It explores the dataset, performs data preprocessing, and trains machine learning models to predict employee turnover. The notebook is well-documented with detailed explanations and comments to aid understanding.

Get Started
